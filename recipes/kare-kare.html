        <p>This perennial Filipino favorite usually starts with a base of oxtails, 
            beef stew cuts, pork hocks or tripe. Traditionally, the choice meat is simmered for hours to 
            desired tenderness and and along with a variety of vegetables such as banana heart, long beans 
            and eggplant, it's pulled together into a stew with ground peanuts for flavor, toasted ground rice 
            for thickening  and annatto for coloring.</p>
